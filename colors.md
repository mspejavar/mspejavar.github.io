												The color affair
Some might talk of the swing of emotions, some might talk about the purity of chroma, few, unconsciously, may start dwelling into the good bygone days, some might hark to their favorite color and some, might not have even given it a thought, when asked, ‘what is the first thing that strikes your mind when spoken to about COLOR’.
I personally feel it’s all to do with the evoking of emotions, influencing our state of mind at the first glance. Living in a world dosed with color, we still neglect their sway. So, Give it a thought if you haven’t!
Most of us shy away from bright or eye popping colors which we secretly admire. May be because we give too much attention to the world’s thoughts or afraid we can’t pull it off well and look disastrous.
Yes, sometimes colors might be a little disastrous but mostly they create magic to make that outfit look to the nines. It’s always a Fab or Drab situation. To pull off that statement outfit, we must certainly  know them hues pretty well. 
This space of interest is all about the effortless splashing out of a solo hue or mixing  few up to reinvent a whole new color palette to give life to a look.
Also, I’ll try giving you a vision of the color’s affair with fashion, like tossing around colors for specific occasions, bringing seasonal hues into life, focusing on the popular patterns and prints that are on a different level on a scale of fashion and what not.
So join me on my journey while I play with the wonderful vibrant Colors!

P.S- My favourite color is BLACK. What’s yours?
