Don’t you think ethnic and folk sway are much forsaken subjects today? We do put on contemporary clothes but do not give much attention to the know-how of it.  May be we should give a little importance to their grassroots.

Today, We are brought up in the ‘go with the flow’ environment which subconsciously gets us on the up to the minute platform. To a great extent this works but to deal with the society wisely, there are certain unique elements that we are missing out on. Clearly, We are all very much in touch with the world when we go hand in hand with the modern world but don’t you think at the same time staying in touch with cultural aspects of the world will set you on the balance floor. Like taking up just one motif from any culture, say one of the motifs of the assamese culture, we’d see a lot more stories to that design and fabric than just the origin which is definitely interesting. Experimenting that with styles that are very common on the streets definitely sets us different and creative, but most importantly helps us understand the modern moralities and ancient ethics.

So this space of interest would focus on the mixing of the modish pieces with the roots of different parts of the world. Besides, the origin and know-how of a clothing from the roots.
