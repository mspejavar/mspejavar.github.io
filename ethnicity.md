Don’t you think ethnic and folk sway are much forsaken subjects today? We do put on contemporary clothes but do not give much attention to the know-how of it.  May be we should give a little importance to their grassroots.

Today, We are brought up in the ‘go with the flow’ environment which subconsciously gets us on the up to the minute platform. To a great extent this works but to deal with the society wisely, there are certain unique elements that we are missing out on. Clearly, We are all very much in touch with the world when we go hand in hand with the modern world but don’t you think at the same time staying in touch with cultural aspects of the world will set you on the balance floor. Let’s take up just one motif from any culture, say one from the Assamese culture, we’ll find a wealth of stories behind the design and fabric besides just the origin, which is definitely interesting see a lot more stories to that design and fabric than just the origin which is definitely interesting. Experimenting with styles that are very common on the streets, as well as those that are yet to come to the fore, definitely sets us different and enhances our creativity, but more importantly helps us understand the modern moralities and ancient ethics.

So this space of interest focuses on the mixing of the modish pieces with the roots of different parts of the world as well as the origin and in depth knowledge of clothing straight up from the roots.
