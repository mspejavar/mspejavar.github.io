Eat, sleep, travel, repeat. Ever coveted for something like this? Or are you that person who’s just not too keen on travelling? No matter who you are, getting consumed by wanderlust is inevitable. And when it happens all you need to do is make a move and experience it yourself rather than merely listening to stories. We could never inhale that air of pleasure until we witness it ourselves, like how we just cannot understand the beauty of the sunlit canals of Venice through words or pictures.
Most of us are left with a massive world of experiences, be it with family, friends, the place or just yourself. But most importantly, we are left with becoming a happier self. Also, Some of us might feel great when dressed to those well made travel standards, definitely adding to that happier self. On that note, How about adding a bit of style quotient to our dressing while travelling? Doing so will give an instant lift to the lifestyle, I feel. Some might just opt for oversized clothes throwing the main focus on comfort while some real fashion fanatics wouldn’t even accept this. Dressing up while travelling must be a balance of both the C’s, Comfort and Classy.  While on one hand, Clothing up with a little bit of style can elevate your experiences, on the other, when dressing up well while travelling indirectly offers the locals and the place some fine respect, ultimately  spreading that contentment all over.
 Besides the travel dressing tastes, there are many more factors that count on the experience chapter, like, the enchanting scenic splendors, rejoicing the seasonal spring of a destination, road tripping around with the best of friends, going through the most eye-grabbing adventures, getting lost in a serene world, spotting the strangest of strange creatures out there, getting spiritual at the abode of holy shrines, shopping and window shopping at the local crafted, fine dining as well as street food at the local’s best and so on.
So, here’s where I could remind myself of the finest travelling experiences I’ve had and pen them all down, while suggesting some of the coolest hangouts, restaurants, shopping streets and much more.
