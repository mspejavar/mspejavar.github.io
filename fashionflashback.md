It all began with the ancient civilizations as the cultures were different everywhere and each of them had its own one of a kind ensemble. Soon did the kings and the queens continue the legacy and establish the trends and these were passed on till the late 18th century, making way for the popular and influential decades of fashion which are quite in vogue even today. 

Looking back on those rich classic days is something worthwhile. Moreover, Knowing our yesteryears well, will undoubtedly help us subsist with the muddles and odds of the present and the near future. Besides, We all know how past kindles the present and so does the present to the future. On that note, let’s talk about the repetitions. History repeats itself and so does fashion. A trend is in mod, gets on the rapid circulation spree and then it vanishes off. After sometime, the very same style returns in potency and the entire fashion sphere falls head over heels for it. This is more like a universal truth. Most of the pieces have not only made a comeback but also been striking the trend line. And if you have hit the modish places yet, then noticing the 90s inspired off shoulder blouse is a sure thing. In parallel, the 70s kick flare trousers are officially back and are ruling the fashion lists now.

So, This section is purely dedicated to the history of fashion where I’d be pulling out some of the popular fashion trends from the real glamour years that have made a comeback and showing how fashion has evolved over the past.
Let’s relive the past in here soon!
