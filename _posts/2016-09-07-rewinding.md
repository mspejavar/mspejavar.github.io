### They say that nostalgia paints a smile on the stony face of the past.
And I’m certain that this feeling is enjoyed by the millennial crowd and of course, I’m broaching the warmer side here. With the unforgettable faint fragrances to the long-lost sounds to the archaic photographic albums, nostalgia drives around most of the times and these mentioned factors kindle that positive sensation in us, taking us back to the past to relive that moment again .

Every time someone mentions something related to our bygone days, we just pause right there, slowly crashing back in time feeling all the joy. Did we just feel nostalgic about nostalgia? 

Like everyone of us, I’ve always had this habit of looking through the overloaded photo albums of the past and rejoicing over them. And over time, it became more of a comfort therapy to me which was an added advantage. And those childhood days, especially the baby to the preteen stage which I spent in Singapore, which went by easily, were the ones I’d always crave for. Besides, those pictures have always reminded me of the bucolic setting and the emotional importance of that place where I started it all. So I decided to visit Singapore, after 14 years, for that ephemeral feeling of reliving my childhood. And this time I hoped to capture it forever, in the digital world.

Likewise, fashion is inspired by the best of the past. And today’s post is all about how we have relived the past in fashion and celebrated every bit of that.
Without digging much into the specificality to any decade of fashion, I picked out some popular throwback pieces that would set the retro affair right with the nostalgic waves channeling through. I have selected the ones that are quite the rage in the market and also that I have been lusting over for a while.

Before I move on to the ensemble details, I’d love to tap on few of my favorite flashback styles that have been getting reinvented year after year.
I’ve been spotting the off shoulder crop and choker trend all around the place now, which is likely given the name choker top these days. These trends indeed, have come a long way and have paved their way into mainstream fashion.
To speak of the choker and crop trends, they were never in the backseat, after they entered the streets in the 90s. And the off shoulders, which entered way back in the mid 1800s, got in-vogue in the 80s and 90s and now, they are ‘Oh so drool worthy’!
Coming to think of the 80s and 90s, I got reminded of the ever charming Princess Diana (who my mum totally admires) whose dress up game with the pearls and off shoulder neckline was always on point.
There’s a lot more in store and the list would just keep flowing when it’s to do with the Past fashion and today, Fashion completely takes its inspiration from that very list.

Here, I have brought in two looks, fusing the chosen few retro staples in a random fashion manner. In the first one, I updated my striped off shoulder crop with a matching ribbon like choker which I paired with my high waist trousers which are brought to you straight from the 50s feminine style lines. And to nail this retrofit, threw on my 90s inspired platform wedges.
For the second one, which was more of a vintage style, I paired the same crop with an umbrella skirt which totally takes its inspiration from the great Victorian era. Finally to bind the entire look together, got my hands on the layered pearl chain.
Lastly, moving over to the color palette, it was all about recreating fashion flashback in red and white, the colors of the Singaporean flag.

Hope you enjoy today's post! See you untill next time :)
