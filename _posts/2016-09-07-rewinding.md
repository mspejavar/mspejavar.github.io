## Rewind the moment

Don’t  we all indulge in nostalgising and recalling fond memories very often? 
And I’m pretty much sure, this is enjoyed by an average millennial/crowd and of course, I’m broaching the warmer side here. With the unforgettable faint fragrances to the long-lost sounds to the good old photographic memories of albums, nostalgia drives around most of the times and these mentioned factors kindle that positive sensation in us taking us back to the past conveniently.
Also, every time someone mentions or we hear that one thing related to our yester lives, we just cease right there, and slowly crash back in time with all the joy. Sounds familiar? Then, we are along the same liness. 
Like a lot of you, I’ve always had this practice of looking through the past overloaded photo albums and rejoicing over them. And over time, it became more of a comfort therapy to me which is even better! And those easy Childhood days, specially the baby to the preteen stage which I spent in Singapore were the days I’d always crave for. Besides, Those sets of pictures have always reminded me the importance and dearly cost of that city. We all know it, the feeling itself makes us crave for the past but it didn’t end there for me. I did visit the city after 14 long years and reliving the past in the moment certainly came my way and it was…….
And today’s post is all about How we have  been reliving the past in fashion  and also how we have been celebrating every bit of that.

Without digging much into the specificality of any decade of fashion, I picked out some popular throwback pieces that would set the retro affair right with the nostalgic waves channeling through. I have selected the ones that are quite the rage in the market and also that I have been lusting over for a while.

Before I move on to the ensemble details, I’d love to tap on few of my favourite flashback styles that have been getting reinvented year after year.
I’ve been spotting the off shoulder crop and choker trend all around the place now, which is likely given the name choker top these days. These trends indeed, have come a long way and have paved their way into mainstream fashion.
To speak of the choker and crop trends, they were never in the backseat, after they entered the streets in the 90s. And the off shoulders, which entered way back in the mid 1800s, got in-vogue in the 80s and 90s and now, they are ‘Oh so drool worthy’!
Coming to think of the 80s and 90s, I got reminded of the ever charming Princess Diana who my mum totally admires and also, who’s dress up game with the pearls and off shoulder neckline was always on point.
There’s a lot more in store and the list would just keep flowing when it’s to do with the Past fashion and today, Fashion completely takes its inspiration from that very list.

Here, I have brought in two looks, fusing the chosen few retro staples in a random fashion manner. In the first one, I updated my striped off shoulder crop with a matching ribbon like choker which I paired with my High waist trousers which are brought to you straight from the 50s feminine style lines. And to nail this retrofit, threw on my 90s inspired platform wedges.
For the second one, which was more of a vintage style, I paired my same crop with an umbrella skirt which totally takes its inspiration from the great Victorian era. Finally to bind the entire look together, got my hands on the layered pearl chain.
Lastly, moving over to the color palette, It was all about recreating fashion flashback in red and white, the colors of the Singaporean flag.
