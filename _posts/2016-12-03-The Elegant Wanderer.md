How balanced are we playing dress up?
Not all of us stick to the theory of different clothing for different motives.
And gone are the days when we stayed loyal to specific styles.

Every clothing style must be appreciated and we live in a date where embracing a cocktail of two different styles, preferably fusing the old tradition and the new, makes for a great look.
I've always relished designing, revamping or even customizing my clothes be it Indian or modern.
And this time I bumped into my granny's timeless Kancheepuram silk saree which was lying there like it was given no hoots but was too exquisite to be given or thrown away. It was certainly the delicate color crush of shades of orange and the subtleness of the temple border of the saree which I fell for.
I knew turning it into a skirt would serve me well and to add to it, it was tailored precisely the way I'd imagined, a closely pleated skirt with pockets on both sides.   
Being hung up on the "adding an Indian touch" usually, I thought why not the other way round here.
I decided to take it to a mod level by picking a truly fast moving piece, the white off shoulder blouse itself. I don’t think this trend would ever go off track.
And the bohemian chic look is the epitome of trend nowadays. Who doesn't love it?
This white off-shoulder blouse with a tie up in front would completely bring to light the inner boho spirit giving softness to the south Indian look.
Working on the south Indian look a little more, I paired with the outfit some antique pieces which resembled the popular temple jewellery; here it was the coin chain which is back in the market. Besides, my loosely braided hair and the berry lips played fair to the overall look. 
And not to forget the beautifully rustic backdrop which did so much justice to the outfit.

If you’re on a look out for some blending fashion, you could try something like this and also, reuse old silk sarees in many other ways like kurtis, anarkalis, Indian gowns and so on. 

I hope you guys like this post and if you happen to create any kind of cocktail style, I'd love to know!
