> Be comfortable in your own skin. If you’re not, you’ll never convince others that you are.

In my opinion, street style would do all the more justice to this quote. There is no way we can go wrong with this style as it is all to do with one’s own choice and taste. So, just let that street style affair work.

A couple of months ago, while I was in Singapore, my eyes were caught by this pretty crop with a quote that went like, ‘And now I’ll do what’s best for me’. That very moment I knew I had to have it. It totally did all the talking for me as it was apt for my state of affair and let me tell you I hail from an engineering milieu and I accepted it as it came my way. But now I have decided to give a moment to my choices, making it worth and here I am!

Every girl has a few must have essentials and one of them for me are skirts. Considering my closet, my tastes and that wanting to make the chic factor bloom out, I chose to express street style in two ways, fun and poised styles.

The crop that I wore was turtleneck also called “polo and roll” neck, basically a high one, which is what I usually prefer. And I played around with the suspenders to add a tinge of vintage charm to the crop.
On the bottom front, the skirts I wore were asymmetric hem skirts that are greatly reaching the heights of popularity now. I love the fact that they can be sported versatile and not to forget, that effortless look you perceive from these hems.
For the first look, which I titled, ‘The Fun-Around Chic’, I paired my crop with a side high low skirt, which drapes down like a curtain from the knee area. I luckily found the right pair of golden shoes to tear with this chic look.
For the second one, titled, ‘That Poised Girl’, I wore my bodycon asymmetric cut out skirt and to do more justice to the poised street look, I swapped my pair of golden sneakers with golden peeps and I was good to go!
Being a cosmic lover of the pure combination of black and white, I conveniently chose this fusion for my color palette along with a dash of gold that added more to the vibe.

So this is it. I’d love to know how you guys thought of today’s post. See you all soon with another post! ☺

P.S- The skirt that I wore for my first look, the side high low hem skirt was my made by me. It’s definitely super easy to make and I’d come up with a post for that very soon!
