It's the dawn of a season and most of us throw open the doors of our closets, going through and cleaning them.
So, when I usually sit back, I rediscover all kinds of jumbled items, from the all-time favourites to the daily essential staples to the items that once made our hearts sway and finally to the simply untouched ones. Most of us are emotionally tholed to certain items in there and Revamping or Redefining them to mod standards or to just our styling senses makes for a finer idea, adding more to the closet efficiently and saving ourselves from spending some extra bucks.
Plus talk about that invariable feel of contentment when we just shake up our closets and add a bit of our style habits to them.

So here's my side of the tale, while I bumped into this never sported navy blue shrug.I decided I'd sport it as a tie-off crop top, wearing the back side of the shrug in the front, for I loved the embroidery detail it had at the back of the shrug. The back neckline of a shrug is always high if you have noticed, shaping the way for that perfect high neck crop top which was easily a brownie point besides the embroidery detail.
I paired this shrug turned crop with a charcoal grey pencil skirt, a member of the unused community in my closet which was a little on the looser side from the lower thighs to the knee area. As a note Iâ€™d say, an ideal fit for a pencil skirt is quite hard to find as we all slip into different classes of body shapes.
May be I could have altered it to acquire that wonder fit but thought changing the look with a bit of an edge to bag that desired fit would be a better end. Here, I Slightly draped one of the side seams and pinned it up, leaving no space and fixing that fit. I Wrapped up this look with chocolate brown accessories, a pair of strappy wedges and a fringe sling bag.
The colors I pulled out here , Navy blue, Grey, and chocolate brown, are pretty simple yet an essential quotidian palette that we all spot on the streets and one can never go wrong with such a palette.

This pretty much summed up today's post and yes, I'd definitely recommend you'll to clean your closets seasonally for new fashion walks in every season and getting gushed with ideas to revamp those unused attached pieces will be a sure thing!

Hope you enjoy this post as much as I enjoyed shooting for it!
Until next time, See you :)
