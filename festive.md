As we all know, Indian culture is considered first and supreme culture of the world and Religion plays a predominant role here. These vastly varied religions have their own traditions, customs, ceremonies, weddings and festivals. Speaking of festivals, Celebrations here start as soon as the heat gives way to the magical monsoon season and extends till the soft sparkling spring. There’s always something just around the corner to get us busy gorging on amazing food, dazzling in our new and colorful attires and making wondrous set of memories and much more. I believe one should never miss out on celebrating festivals if the real India is to be experienced. Along similar lines, weddings are equally fun which goes on for days making it quite a prolonged affair. The carnival of dressing up for friends, cousins, family is as important as it is for the bride and the groom. Also, the color of the attire we opt for is pretty much important and leaves a mark as it reflects the range of emotions felt by us.

Witnessing the joyful and radiant series of events is undoubtedly no less than a delightful experience, but showcasing and scripting it for you would give me an even greater pleasure, I must say. Besides, I’ll also be concentrating on various color themes, dos and don’ts, interesting facts and untold stories contributing to the sheen of a particular festival and culture. Lastly, exploring festivals and weddings of different cultures from the world will be seen here through the course of my journey.
