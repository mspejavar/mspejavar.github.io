From the fair drama stage, to the sly game of chance and will, from the celebrations and ceremonies, to the unfair yet unavoidable tragedies, Life has different roads for different beings it spawns. Or perhaps it’s just our different perspectives.
We ought to grasp things that come our way and make the most of it.
No matter what you do or how you do it, it’s just the Happiness warmth that matters ultimately, that makes the journey equally important to the destination.
And only when you’re living in the moment do you actually earn that contentment.
Having said all of that, I’d like to share all that I love about life in here.
This space of interest will be a photo story of all my casual experiences, endless infatuation for food, fitness, adventure, outdoors and what not.
